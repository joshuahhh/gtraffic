gtraffic
========

This little snippet scrapes traffic map tiles from Google, stitches them together into larger images, then outputs a (time-labelled) time-series of these images for further use. I recommend making animated gifs using ImageMagick's "convert" tool.

It's none too documented, but you'll get the idea.
